# jQuery Field Compare String

## Function

jQuery.jFieldCompareString

## Description

jQuery plugin to compare the exact value of an input[type=text] or textarea to a text string html element.

A jQuery plugin for **live comparison** between the typed value of an **input[type=text]** or **textarea** form fields and the **text string** contained by a specified html element. It presents feedback on the transcription progress and can also protect the form field from copy-paste and drag-drop events (optional feature) to ensure that the user is required to type in the exact reference text string. The comparison is case-sensitive so the typed text has to be exact to trigger the success message.
